# Advent of code 2021

My solutions for AoC 2021.

I am using Haskell as I am learning the language.  

# Running the code

I am using with vanilla Haskell (GHC 8.10.7), so a basic installation is sufficient.

For each day, simply compile and execute the binary:
```
> ghc .\day_01.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( day_01.hs, day_01.o )
Linking day_01.exe ...
> .\day_01.exe
(the answer)
```
